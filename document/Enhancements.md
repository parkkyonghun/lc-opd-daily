1. Enhanced Data Visualization with Interactive Charts
   The current chart implementation in the Consolidated View is functional but has room for significant improvement in interactivity and user experience.

This enhanced tooltip provides more context about each data point, showing not just the raw values but also additional metadata about the branch. You could further enhance this by:
Adding percentage comparisons to the previous period
Including visual indicators for trends (up/down arrows)
Adding a small sparkline within the tooltip showing historical performance
For chart interaction, implement click events to drill down into specific data points: 2. Responsive Loading States and Error Handling
The current implementation has basic loading states, but could benefit from more sophisticated feedback mechanisms.
his implementation provides:
A skeleton loading state that mimics the actual chart layout
A detailed error message with a clear retry action
Empty state guidance for users who haven't generated a report yet

3. Custom Date Range Selection
   Extending beyond the current day/week/month options will give users more flexibility in analyzing data.

4. Branch Performance Benchmarking
   Adding the ability to benchmark branches against each other or against targets would provide valuable insights.

5. Notification System for Missing Reports
   Implementing alerts for branches that haven't submitted reports would improve data completeness.
   This feature would require:
   #Additional state management
   #A function to fetch the last report date for each branch
   #Functions to handle the reminder actions
   #Adding a useEffect hook to fetch the last report dates when the component renders:
