Continuing Improvements for the Daily Reports System
After reviewing our context and the codebase, let's focus on areas we haven't addressed yet that could use improvement:

1. Topbar and User Interface Integration
   The TopBar component has a search input that doesn't appear to be fully functional:
   Improvements:
   Implement functional search across reports and branches
   Add search suggestions with recent searches
   Add keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+/ or /) to focus the search input
2. Authentication Flow and User Management
   The current system shows a logout button in the Sidebar, but the logout functionality isn't fully implemented:
   Improvements:
   Implement proper logout with session clearing
   Add confirmation dialog to prevent accidental logouts
   Add session timeout detection and refresh mechanism
   Add "Remember me" functionality for login
3. Breadcrumbs for Navigation
   There are no breadcrumbs in the current UI, which could help with navigation:
   Implementation:
4. Filter Persistence and URL State
   Currently, when filtering reports, the state isn't persisted in the URL:
   Improvements:
   Implement URL-based state for filters to enable bookmarking and sharing specific views
   Persist filter preferences in localStorage
   Add "Reset Filters" button for quick clearing
5. Form Validation Improvements
   The CreateReportModal and EditReportModal could benefit from more robust validation:
   Improvements:
   Add client-side validation for all inputs with immediate feedback
   Implement a validation library like zod, yup, or react-hook-form
   Add more specific error messages for different validation scenarios
6. Accessibility Enhancements
   Several components could benefit from accessibility improvements:
   Improvements:
   Add proper aria labels to interactive elements
   Implement keyboard navigation for all interactive components
   Ensure proper focus management in modals and dropdowns
   Add skip links for keyboard users
   Test with screen readers
7. Offline Support and Data Persistence
   The system could benefit from offline capabilities:
   Improvements:
   Implement service workers for offline access to previously loaded data
   Add IndexedDB for local storage of draft reports
   Implement sync mechanism when connection is restored
   Add visual indicators for offline mode
8. Internationalization and Localization
   The system seems to lack internationalization support:
   Improvements:
   Implement i18n with next-intl or react-i18next
   Extract all hardcoded strings to translation files
   Add language selection in user settings
   Format dates and numbers according to locale
9. Performance Optimization
   There are several areas where performance could be improved:
   Improvements:
   Implement windowing (virtualization) for large data tables using react-window or react-virtualized
   Add memoization for expensive calculations
   Optimize re-renders with React.memo and useCallback
   Implement code splitting for large components
10. Report Comments and Collaboration
    The current system allows for comments but lacks advanced collaboration features:
    Improvements:
    Add threaded comments on reports
    Implement @mentions to notify users
    Add comment editing and deletion
    Implement real-time updates for collaborative editing
